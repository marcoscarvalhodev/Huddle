# Technologies

The main technologies that I used in this project were:

* React
* TypeScript
* Styled Components

# Run on VSCode

To run it on VSCode you should install **serve** globally in your VSCode Terminal:
* **npm install -g serve**
(if you already have **serve** installed you can skip this step)
  
and lastly:
* **serve -s build**

and so you just press CTRL + Click on the **local** section created and a static build from the application will be rendered in your web browser.
